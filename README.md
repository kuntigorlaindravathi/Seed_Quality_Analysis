# Seed_Quality_Analysis
I done a project on Traceability of Seed Quality.This Ethereum blockchain system,utilizes three contracts."ManufactureinformationContract" manages seed batch details."VerificationContract" verifies and stores quality scores, linked to the former. "testingdatacontract" assesses seed quality using moisture, germination, and impurity levels.
